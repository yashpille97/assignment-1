Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following
# Takes two numbers as input from the user:
num1=float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2=float(input("Enter the second number: "))
# Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
addition=num1+num2
subtraction=num1-num2
multiplication=num1*num2
if num2 !=0:
division=num1/num2
else:
division="Undefined(can not be divide by zero)"
# Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
print("\nResults:")
print("ADDITION" ,addition)
print("SUBTRACTION" ,subtraction)
print("MULTIPLICATION" ,multiplication)
print("DIVISION" ,division)

Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
#  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
first_name=input("Enter your first name: ")
last_name=input("Enter your last name: ")
# Concatenating names with a space
full_name=first_name + " " + last_name
#  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.
print("Hello," ,full_name)
print("Welcome To the Python Program")
