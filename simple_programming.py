# Takes two numbers as input from the user:
num1=float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2=float(input("Enter the second number: "))
# Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
addition=num1+num2
subtraction=num1-num2
multiplication=num1*num2

division=num1/num2


# Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
